See the thing with harbours, and sea walls. And islands. Ref points. 
35 years ago I first went to Palma, and on my last trip there 2 years ago? No change. 
Same here in Bali. No rise over last 7 years.
Amsterdam last trip 18 mths ago? No rise.
South of France? No rise"

Sep 9, 2022","Learnings on my trip to Bali.

1) It's a pretty long walk from the BNI City MRT to the BNI City Airport Train Station.

2) The Airport Train doesn't take my e-money card.

3) The machines stopped selling tickets for the train I wanted a few mins before I got there."

Tram seems more like a tourist attraction."
