Hello traveler,
This is a good time to visit and stay in Bali, Enjoy your time longer here with B211A visa (up to 180 days). You will have plenty of time to explore the nature and culture of Bali island or the other Island in Indonesia."

 Please try to build an airport in Bali, Rajasthan. Because many Rajasthani's living in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are from this area. If an airport is built here, it will be very convenient for the people here. Many tourist places"
